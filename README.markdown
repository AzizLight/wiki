Sinik
-----

**Sinik** is a personal wiki written using Sinatra. That means that it's file-based and that the only user's credentials are also stored in a file. The password is obviously encrypted. Here are a list of its features:

- Flat-file storage.
- Wiki pages are written in Markdown.
- Support for one level of namespacing.
- Support for syntax highlighting.
